# REMATCH Cheat Menu ‚öΩÔ∏èüí£

*REMATCH Cheat Menu* is the on-screen control hub that lets you **freeze stamina, loop Extra Effort, and mangle possession clocks** in *REMATCH*, Sloclap‚Äôs lightning-fast 5 v 5 football brawler. Built as a pop-up overlay, the menu attaches to the game process, follows dynamic pointers, and slaps instant hotkeys on every vital bar‚Äîso you dominate without alt-tab gymnastics.

## Overview

*REMATCH* flips traditional soccer by giving each player direct third-person control and a twin-bar resource system: green **Stamina** and blue **Extra Effort**. 
Ranked lobbies are server-authoritative, but offline practice and custom rooms load entirely client-side, making memory edits viable for drills and clip farming. 

The Cheat Menu injects at launch, scans for fresh pointers after every patch, and paints a translucent UI that floats on the right edge of the screen. Toggle a cheat, and a multithreaded writer spam-locks the chosen value in <1 ms cycles‚Äîfaster than the game drains it.

## Why Our Cheat Menu Obliterates the Competition üí•

Most trainers still chase shooter staples like ammo & HP‚Äîstats *REMATCH* doesn‚Äôt even have. By laser-targeting **Stamina, Extra Effort, and timer logic**, our menu bends the exact levers the meta revolves around, letting you spam flicks and sky volleys while everyone else gasps for breath. 
Auto pointer scanning patches itself whenever Sloclap tweaks memory maps, so you‚Äôre back in action seconds after a hotfix. 
And because the overlay lives inside the render layer, you never lose situational awareness to an external window.
